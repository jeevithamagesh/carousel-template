   -  Carousels are often used as a gallery to display a series of images
  -   However, more complex content, such as teasers, articles,
    or entire sections of web pages can also be shown inside carousels

- Inject the two services in 'constructor'
- In **component class**, declare the variables used

 `imagedata : String ;`
                  `  limit : any ;`
- In **ngOnInit**
`this.imageData = this.imgService.getImages();`
>**Note:** imagedata is variable used in imageservice
 > imgservice is the keyword for the service
  - write a function

`ngDoCheck() { this.limit = this.cService.assignLimit(1, 2, 4); }`

  >**Note:** limit - is variable used in carouselservice
                    cservice- is the keyword for the service
                    ngDoCheck-used for checking the changes for every time
